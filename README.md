VisualTrace
===========
This is my very first git-commit!!
I am Srikanth, a Masters Student in Computer Science at Stony Brook University. I have varied interests which will be proven soon by the variety of projects I will be uploading into git in the coming future. My interests are Application Development, Data Mining, Natural Language Processing, Wireless Networks! Now that the grown up part is over, I am also interested in Singing, Dancing, Manga, Quora, Reading and Writing. So here goes my first project!

Web based Visual traceroute is a web application which plots live  command on Google maps. Our application gets the source and destination from user and submits the traceroute request to a third party internet measurement service, RIPE Atlas REST API. Our application also corrects the traceroute anomalies and maintains a cache of traceroutes to make the application real-time.

VisualTrace
===========

Web based Visual traceroute is an application which plots live traceroute command on Google maps. Our application gets the source and destination from user and submits the traceroute request to a third party internet measurement service, RIPE Atlas REST API. Our application also corrects the traceroute anomalies and maintains a cache of traceroutes to make the application real-time.
